# PointDisplay
A program about displaying 3D points,based in QT5 and OpenGL.

I finnished my program with the help of Cai Wancang.

And his GitHubï¼šhttps://github.com/cwc1987

As Qt is cross-platform framework, so used freetype and ftgl in my program to create font.

freetype-2.5.3:http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.5.3/

ftgl-2.1.3:http://sourceforge.net/projects/ftgl/files/FTGL%20Source/2.1.3~rc5/
